en.sorceressHutHello
Hello, I'm the sorceress. I could teach you one thing or two about magic. I can also give you some interesting things, or cast spells for you. But everything has a price! And this price will be lollipops. A lot of them.
en.sorceressHutClickedGrimoire
This is a grimoire made for beginners. By carrying it with you in quests, you will be able to cast simple but useful spells. You need this! Only 5 000 lollipops.
en.sorceressHutBuyGrimoireButton
Buy this grimoire (5 000 lollipops)
en.sorceressHutBuyGrimoireSpeech
Thanks for buying! You will be able to cast three spells with this grimoire. Good luck!
en.sorceressHutClickedGrimoire2
This is an advanced grimoire. By carrying it with you in quests, you will be able to cast two advanced spells. I wrote it myself, which wasn't easy. 20 000 lollipops is a fair price.

en.sorceressHutClickedCauldron
This is my cauldron. It allows me to brew magic potions. I could sell it to you, but it's very precious... it will cost you 100 000 lollipops.

Buy the cauldron (100 000 lollipops)
en.sorceressHutBuyCauldronSpeech
Thanks a lot! 100 000 lollipops for me! I also gave you a brewing manual. It's going to be useful.
en.sorceressHutClickedHat
I have a nice hat, indeed! But I really can't sell it to you. It is waaaay too precious. Really, I can't. Don't insist. No. No no no I shouldn't do that. Oh well, I'll trade it, but for 1 000 000 000 lollipops. You probably won't be able to pay that anyway.
en.sorceressHutBuyHatButton
Buy the hat (1 000 000 000 lollipops)
en.sorceressHutBuyHatSpeech
One billion lollipops for meeeeee! But I don't have a hat anymore.. but one billion lollipops, wow! .. It was worth it.

Hello! I'm a very old bread oven. I used to cook tons of good pastries, but no one is using me anymore. Maybe... maybe you could help me? Just let me take some sweets from you! Don't worry, you won't regret it! You can trust me.
en.castleBigRoomHovenNotEnough # INFORMAL PRONOUN
Oh... you don't have enough sweets, I can't do anything. I'm just useless. I'm the useless bread oven, that's how you should call me.
en.castleBigRoomHovenSpeechMadePainAuChocolat # INFORMAL PRONOUN
Yay! Thanks a lot! I used 100 candies and a chocolate bar, and I made you... a pain au chocolat! It's my favourite pastry, I hope you'll like it too!
en.castleBigRoomHovenSpeechHappy # INFORMAL PRONOUN
Hey! If you want me to cook another pastry, just tell me! I'd love to help you.
en.castleBigRoomHovenSpeechHappyNotEnough # INFORMAL PRONOUN
Oh, you don't have enough sweets, sadly. I need 100 candies and a chocolate bar. Come back when you'll have that!
en.castleBigRoomHovenLetHovenTakeButton
Let the oven take all the sweets it wants to take
en.castleBigRoomHovenThanks
Thanks, oven!

Oh, so you want challenge? I think you should make a trip to hell itself, it is known that the devil is a tough challenger. Jump on my back and I'll take you there!
en.dragonTalkingFameSpeech # INFORMAL PRONOUN
The best way to become famous is to face the developer himself. I know where he lives and I could take you there. But be prepared, this won't be easy.
en.dragonTalkingCandiesSpeech # INFORMAL PRONOUN
Ultimately, the thing we all want is candies, isn't it? I think a friend of mine could help you with that. You will recognise him easily, he has only one eye. Just tell him that you know me.
en.dragonTalkingChallengeAnswer
Let's go then!

I am ready.
