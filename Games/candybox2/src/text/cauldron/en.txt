Health potion / The health potion is one of the easiest to brew, really. It only requires candies. Used in quests, it will heal you by giving you back 100 health points. / Instructions : - Put 100 candies in your cauldron - Mix for a few seconds - Put into bottles / Just like for any potion, you can of course multiply the quantities. For example, if you use 300 candies instead of 100, you will get 3 health potions.
