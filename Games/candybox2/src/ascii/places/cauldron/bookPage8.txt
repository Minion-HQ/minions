              The P potion
              ¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨¨
  The P potion is a strange one. You
cannot predict what it is going to do.
It could heal you or damage you, make
you stronger or weaker, or even turn you
into someone (something?) else.

  And it's also hard to brew!

  Instructions :
   - Put 500 candies in your cauldron
   - Mix for a few seconds
   - Stop mixing
   - Add 100 times more candies than the
number of seconds you mixed. For example
if you mixed during 4 seconds, you'll
need to add 400 candies. Do not multiply
this quantity, even if you want to make
more than one potion.
   - Heat up until the water is lukewarm
   - Stop heating up
   - Add some lollipops
   - Mix
   - Put into bottles!
