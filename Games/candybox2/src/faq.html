    <h3>I found a bug!</h3>
    <p>
      That would be very nice of you to report it by sending me a mail at aniwey@gmail.com. Thanks!
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the following are NOT bugs :<br/>
      <ul>
        <li>The behaviour of octopus kings</li>
        <li>Anything about the squirrel's game</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Which language did you use to make the game?</h3>
    <p>
      The game is written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript">TypeScript</a>, a language which compiles to javascript using tsc, the TypeScript compiler. There's also a bit of HTML and a bit of CSS. You can get more information about the source code <a href="source_code.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Where can I find more informations about the source code / ascii art?</h3>
    <p>
      You can check the <a href="source_code.html">source code page</a> and the <a href="ascii_art.html">ascii art page</a>.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h3>I'd like to make a translation! How should I proceed?</h3>
    <p>
      If you want to make a new translation, you can simply contact me at aniwey@gmail.com. All languages are welcome!
    </p>

    <h3>I'd like to donate!</h3>
    <p>
      Wow, that's nice! Donations will help me to cover the server costs (since there are no ads, I'm actually losing money right now ^^), and if the server costs are covered, will help me to develop other cool free games in the future :)
