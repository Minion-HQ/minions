		- Also moved from main thread to updatecurrentroom
	- Converted many things to WebP to lower filesize (30MB!!)
	- Added a graphics button on the main menu. Not sure whether to use it yet
	- Added randomised fading on main menu static
		- Need to implement this for camera static; could use same function?
		
	- Thirtieth commit will mark beta testing phase, in which all the kinks will be worked out.
		- After the bugs are fixed and the port is released, any additions will be quality-of-life ones or optimizations.

Twenty-eighth Commit:
	- Finished custom night
	- Added main menu stars
	- Added error notifier in corner (for unnoticed errors) when in debug mode

		- Add sine fading on static
		- Convert UI to WebP (and convert some back to PNG due to quality loss)
		- I want to finish this by 30th commit.

Twenty-seventh Commit:
	- Added a script loader for HTML builds
	- Added sixth night and customise night (not yet implemented)
	- Fixed typo in debug display
	- Turned off JS error alert if running debug mode (console would be up anyway)

	- Need to:
		- Add sine fading on static
		- Finish custom night implementation (should be easy enough)
		- Main menu stars on achievements

Twenty-fourth Commit:
	- Added draft version of Freddy Fazbear!
	- I forgot the rest; check commits description

Twenty-third Commit:
	- Fixed save.js not being loaded
	- Added animation.js for any animation code.
	- Added transitional animation. Only used on night start at the moment.
	- Commented console messages from SeamlessLoop to prevent clutter. 
	- Again, probably more stuff I forgot.

Twenty-second Commit:
	- Fixed endnight() function
		- Not completely; children cheering doesn't work.
	- Added day to loading screen
	- Fixed stopAmbientSound() not working/crashing the game on debug mode
	- Added debuglog()
	- Fixed gameover by power outage.
	- Probably some other stuff I forgot.

Twenty-first Commit:
	- Added room names to map
	- Added sound for light switch not working
	- Added JS error alert catcher for testers to report errors without needing console up
	- Tweaked night 1 difficulty
	- Added WebP converter to /bin/
	- Added SeamlessLoop.js for fixing the ambient track loops

Twentieth Commit:
	- Added a changelog
	- Fixed "feedopen=true" bug, caused camerafeed to not open when foxxy appeared.
	- Added difficulty settings for nights 1-6
	- Updated sound engine:
		- Sounds are all preloaded for faster playback
		- Individual sounds can only be played one at a time (so no two of the same sound at the same time)
		- Hopefully this fixes sounds not playing back when game is run server-side.
		- Needs work on the functions; pauseSound() for example, to make it future-proof.
	- Added intro picture
	- Fixed highlighting bug.
	- Fixed new game not resetting to night 1.
	- Not an addition but a note; use %s, %i, %f inside console.log to show string, integer and float, respectively.
		- Example: flopper = "hello"; console.log("%s, my name is Sam",flopper);
		- Output is "hello, my name is Sam" in console.
		- Not sure if this is quicker  than console.log(flopper + ", my name is Sam") though.
	- Some other additions I might have forgotten.
