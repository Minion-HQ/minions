# FNAF-JS
The first FNAF game in JavaScript/HTML.

Ported without reverse engineering of the MMF code; port was done entirely by "reflection"

Pretty much finished, just needs method of auth.

Will use NW.js for distribution as executable for Windows, Mac and Linux, as well as Greenworks for DRM to verify the user owns FNAF on Steam. Alternatively, a PHP script.

Includes used:
  - JQuery
  - NW.js
  - Greenworks
  - JQuery timer
  - WebP converter
  - SeamlessLoop.js
  - Script loader by chrysls
  - JSDoc3 (for documentation)

# How to run

- ~~Click "Download Zip" on the right hand side~~
- ~~Extract the zip file somewhere.~~
- ~~Open feed.html in Google Chrome (other browsers may work but are unsupported).~~

In an effort to "clean" my Github repositories of copyrighted content, this is no longer playable as the graphics/sounds are no longer provided. The code is still there, however.
